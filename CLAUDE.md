# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal development website project (lehmann_dev_site). The repository is currently empty and ready for initial setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the following setup steps may be needed:

### For a typical web development project:
```bash
# Initialize package.json
npm init -y

# Install common dependencies (choose based on framework)
npm install # or yarn install

# Start development server
npm run dev # or npm start
```

### For static site generators:
```bash
# Common commands for different frameworks:
# Next.js: npx create-next-app@latest .
# Vite: npm create vite@latest .
# Astro: npm create astro@latest .
```

## Common Commands

*Note: Commands will be updated once package.json is created*

- **Development**: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Test**: `npm test` or `npm run test`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Type Check**: `npm run type-check` or `tsc --noEmit`

## Project Structure

*To be documented as the project structure develops*

## Architecture Notes

*To be documented as the codebase grows*

## Important Notes

- This is a personal development website project
- Project structure and commands should be updated as development progresses
- Consider initializing with a modern web framework (Next.js, Vite, Astro, etc.)
