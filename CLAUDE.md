## Architecture Notes

### Component System
- Uses a shadcn/ui-inspired design system with custom Tailwind colors
- Components are built with composition in mind using React forwardRef patterns
- CSS variables for theming with HSL color values for better dark mode support

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens defined in CSS variables
- Uses `cn()` utility function (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional classes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Interfaces for Project, BlogPost, and ContactForm entities
- Strict TypeScript configuration

### Blog System
- **JSON-based content management**: Articles stored in `src/content/blog/articles.json` for easy editing
- **React Markdown rendering**: GitHub Flavored Markdown support with remark-gfm
- **Dynamic routing**: Blog posts use `[slug]` dynamic routing pattern
- **Rich metadata**: Each post includes title, description, tags, publication date, and featured status
- **Content utilities**: Post filtering, sorting, tag management, and reading time calculation
- **SEO-optimized**: Structured data, metadata generation, and RSS feed integration

### RSS & Sitemap Generation
- Automated RSS feed generation for blog posts
- Sitemap generation for SEO optimization
- Build process integration via Node.js scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Environment-aware URL generation (development vs production)
- RSS feeds include proper metadata, categories, and XML escaping

### SEO & Performance
- Structured data with JSON-LD for blog posts
- Dynamic metadata generation for all pages
- RSS feed linked in HTML head for feed discovery
- Sitemap includes proper lastmod dates and priority values
- Theme provider with system preference detection

### Content Management
- Static project data can be stored in `src/content/projects/`
- Utility functions for date formatting and reading time calculation

## Code Quality Standards

This project prioritizes **readability**, **maintainability**, **YAGNI compliance**, and adherence to **React/Next.js/TypeScript best practices**.

### 📚 Readability Principles
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names that explain intent
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow established patterns for imports, exports, and structure
- **Logical organization**: Group related functionality together
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Keep functions and components focused on a single responsibility
- **Self-documenting code**: Write code that explains itself; add JSDoc for complex logic

### 🔧 Maintainability Focus
- **Small, focused components**: Keep components under 100 lines when possible
- **Single responsibility**: Each component/function should have one clear purpose
- **DRY principles**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions
- **Clear separation of concerns**: UI logic separate from business logic
- **Consistent patterns**: Follow established architectural patterns throughout the codebase
- **Proper abstraction**: Create reusable components and utilities, but avoid over-abstraction

### 🎯 YAGNI Compliance (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **Implement only what's needed**: Don't build features "just in case"
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Optimize when performance issues are identified
- **Simple solutions first**: Choose the simplest approach that meets current requirements
- **Resist over-engineering**: Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- **Delete unused code**: Remove commented code, unused imports, and dead code paths

### ⚛️ React Best Practices
- **Composition over inheritance**: Use component composition for flexibility
- **Custom hooks**: Extract stateful logic into reusable custom hooks
- **Performance optimization**: Use `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `React.memo` judiciously
- **Component size**: Break large components into smaller, focused sub-components
- **State management**: Keep state as local as possible, lift up only when necessary
- **Error boundaries**: Implement error boundaries for robust error handling

### 🚀 Next.js Best Practices
- **App Router patterns**: Use proper server/client component separation
- **SEO optimization**: Implement metadata API and structured data
- **Performance**: Leverage `next/image`, `next/link`, and built-in optimizations
- **Static generation**: Use static generation where possible for better performance
- **API routes**: Keep API routes focused and well-structured
- **Environment configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration

### 🔷 TypeScript Best Practices
- **Strict typing**: Enable strict mode and avoid `any` type
- **Interface definitions**: Create clear, well-documented interfaces
- **Utility types**: Use TypeScript utility types for common patterns
- **Branded types**: Use branded types for better type safety (e.g., `BlogSlug`)
- **Type guards**: Implement type guards for runtime type checking
- **Generic types**: Use generics for reusable, type-safe functions

## Development Guidelines

### 🏗️ Component Architecture
- **Follow established patterns**: Use existing component patterns in `src/components/ui/`
- **Component hierarchy**: Organize components by domain (ui/, sections/, layout/, blog/)
- **Props interface**: Define clear, well-typed props interfaces for all components
- **Forwarded refs**: Use `React.forwardRef` for components that need DOM access
- **Composition patterns**: Prefer composition over prop drilling for complex components

### 🎨 Styling & UI
- **Tailwind utilities**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- **Conditional classes**: Use `cn()` utility for className merging and conditional styles
- **Design system**: Follow the established design tokens and color variables
- **Responsive design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion for smooth, meaningful animations
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

### 🔗 Navigation & Routing
- **Next.js Link**: Use `next/link` for internal navigation
- **Smooth scrolling**: Implement smooth scrolling for hash-based navigation
- **Active states**: Provide clear visual feedback for active navigation items
- **SEO-friendly**: Ensure all routes are accessible and properly indexed

### 📊 Data Management
- **Type safety**: Use strict TypeScript types for all data structures
- **Custom hooks**: Extract data logic into reusable custom hooks
- **State optimization**: Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive operations
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Type checking**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` before committing
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to ensure code quality
- **Performance**: Monitor component re-renders and optimize when necessary
- **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Component Anti-Patterns
- **Monolithic components**: Components over 150 lines
- **Prop drilling**: Passing props through multiple levels
- **Mixed concerns**: Mixing UI logic with business logic
- **Inline styles**: Using style props instead of Tailwind classes
- **Direct DOM manipulation**: Using refs to manipulate DOM directly

### ❌ React Anti-Patterns
- **Missing dependency arrays**: useEffect without proper dependencies
- **Mutating state**: Directly modifying state objects
- **Using array indices as keys**: Using unstable keys in lists
- **Unnecessary state**: Creating state for derived values
- **Class component patterns**: Using legacy patterns in functional components

### ❌ TypeScript Anti-Patterns
- **Using `any`**: Avoiding proper typing
- **Type assertions**: Using `as` without proper validation
- **Optional everything**: Making all props optional
- **Interface pollution**: Adding unrelated properties to interfaces
- **Ignoring strict mode**: Disabling TypeScript strict checks

### ❌ Performance Anti-Patterns
- **Premature optimization**: Optimizing without measuring
- **Missing memoization**: Not memoizing expensive calculations
- **Excessive memoization**: Memoizing everything unnecessarily
- **Large bundle sizes**: Including unused libraries
- **Synchronous operations**: Blocking the main thread unnecessarily
