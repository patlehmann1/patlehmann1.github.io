# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards, best practices, and development patterns that should be followed when contributing to the portfolio website.

## Code Quality Standards

This project prioritizes **readability**, **maintainability**, **YAGNI compliance**, and adherence to **React/Next.js/TypeScript best practices**.

### üìö Readability Principles

#### Clear Naming
- Use descriptive variable and function names that explain intent
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are universally understood
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Boolean variables should be prefixed with `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`

#### Consistent Formatting
- Follow established patterns for imports, exports, and structure
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Group related code together logically
- Follow the existing code style patterns

#### Logical Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use clear module boundaries
- Keep related files in proximity

#### Minimal Cognitive Load
- Keep functions and components focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deeply nested conditional logic
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Break complex operations into smaller, named functions

#### Self-Documenting Code
- Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic or public APIs
- Use TypeScript types to document expected data structures
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior

### üîß Maintainability Focus

#### Small, Focused Components
- Keep components under 100 lines when possible
- If a component exceeds 150 lines, consider breaking it down
- Each component should have a single, clear purpose
- Use composition to build complex UIs from simple components

#### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each component/function should have one clear purpose
- Avoid mixing UI logic with business logic
- Separate data fetching from presentation logic
- Keep state management focused and localized

#### DRY Principles (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions
- Create reusable components for common UI patterns
- Use constants for repeated values
- Avoid duplicating business logic across components

#### Clear Separation of Concerns
- Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- Use custom hooks for stateful logic
- Separate data transformation from presentation
- Maintain clear boundaries between different domains

#### Consistent Patterns
- Follow established architectural patterns throughout the codebase
- Use consistent patterns for error handling
- Maintain consistent API design patterns
- Follow established naming and organization conventions

#### Proper Abstraction
- Create reusable components and utilities when beneficial
- Avoid over-abstraction that obscures functionality
- Abstract at the right level of granularity
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance patterns

### üéØ YAGNI Compliance (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

#### Implement Only What's Needed
- Don't build features "just in case"
- Focus on current requirements, not hypothetical future needs
- Avoid adding complexity for edge cases that may never occur
- Build the simplest solution that meets current requirements

#### Avoid Premature Optimization
- Optimize when performance issues are identified, not before
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements over micro-optimizations
- Consider maintainability cost of optimizations

#### Simple Solutions First
- Choose the simplest approach that meets current requirements
- Prefer standard solutions over custom implementations
- Use existing libraries rather than reinventing solutions
- Start with simple implementations and evolve as needed

#### Resist Over-Engineering
- Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- Avoid creating elaborate frameworks for simple problems
- Keep solutions proportional to the problem size
- Focus on solving the problem at hand

#### Delete Unused Code
- Remove commented code, unused imports, and dead code paths
- Clean up temporary implementations and debugging code
- Remove unused dependencies and utilities
- Regularly audit and clean up the codebase

## Framework-Specific Best Practices

### ‚öõÔ∏è React Best Practices

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Component Anti-Patterns

#### Monolithic Components
- **Problem**: Components over 150 lines become hard to maintain
- **Solution**: Break into smaller, focused sub-components
- **Example**: Split complex forms into field groups and validation logic

#### Prop Drilling
- **Problem**: Passing props through multiple levels unnecessarily
- **Solution**: Use context, composition, or state management
- **Example**: Use context for theme data instead of passing through every component

#### Mixed Concerns
- **Problem**: Mixing UI logic with business logic in components
- **Solution**: Extract business logic to custom hooks or utilities
- **Example**: Move API calls to custom hooks, keep components focused on rendering

#### Inline Styles
- **Problem**: Using style props instead of Tailwind classes
- **Solution**: Use Tailwind utility classes or CSS variables
- **Example**: Use `className="bg-primary"` instead of `style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }}`

#### Direct DOM Manipulation
- **Problem**: Using refs to manipulate DOM directly
- **Solution**: Use React state and props for UI updates
- **Example**: Use state to control visibility instead of `ref.current.style.display`

### ‚ùå React Anti-Patterns

#### Missing Dependency Arrays
- **Problem**: useEffect without proper dependencies causing bugs
- **Solution**: Always include all dependencies or use ESLint rules
- **Example**: Include state variables that the effect uses

#### Mutating State
- **Problem**: Directly modifying state objects
- **Solution**: Use immutable update patterns
- **Example**: Use spread operator or immutability helpers

#### Array Indices as Keys
- **Problem**: Using unstable keys in lists causing render issues
- **Solution**: Use stable, unique identifiers as keys
- **Example**: Use item.id instead of array index

#### Unnecessary State
- **Problem**: Creating state for values that can be derived
- **Solution**: Use computed values or `useMemo`
- **Example**: Calculate filtered lists instead of storing them in state

### ‚ùå TypeScript Anti-Patterns

#### Using `any` Type
- **Problem**: Avoiding proper typing defeats TypeScript benefits
- **Solution**: Use proper types, `unknown` for truly unknown data
- **Example**: Define proper interfaces instead of using `any`

#### Type Assertions Without Validation
- **Problem**: Using `as` without runtime checks
- **Solution**: Implement proper type guards
- **Example**: Validate data structure before type assertion

#### Optional Everything
- **Problem**: Making all props optional to avoid type errors
- **Solution**: Make required props required, use proper defaults
- **Example**: Only make props optional that are truly optional

### ‚ùå Performance Anti-Patterns

#### Premature Optimization
- **Problem**: Optimizing without measuring actual performance issues
- **Solution**: Profile first, optimize specific bottlenecks
- **Example**: Don't memo every component by default

#### Missing Memoization
- **Problem**: Not memoizing expensive calculations that run frequently
- **Solution**: Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
- **Example**: Memoize complex filtering or sorting operations

#### Excessive Memoization
- **Problem**: Memoizing everything unnecessarily
- **Solution**: Only memoize when performance issues are identified
- **Example**: Don't wrap every callback in `useCallback`

#### Large Bundle Sizes
- **Problem**: Including unused libraries or large dependencies
- **Solution**: Use tree shaking, dynamic imports, analyze bundle size
- **Example**: Import only needed functions from utility libraries
