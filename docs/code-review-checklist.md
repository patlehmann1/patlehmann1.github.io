## Content Review

When reviewing changes that include user-facing content, ensure:

### 📝 Natural Language Quality
- [ ] Content sounds conversational and human, not AI-generated
- [ ] No repetitive sentence structures (especially "Whether it's..." patterns)
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive voice where appropriate
- [ ] Tone is personal and authentic, not corporate or robotic

### 🚫 AI-Generated Patterns Avoided
- [ ] No "Whether it's X, Y, or Z" repetitive constructions
- [ ] Corporate buzzwords eliminated ("deliver value", "masters of", "peak performance")
- [ ] Generic startup language avoided ("Let's Build Something Great", "cutting-edge solutions")
- [ ] Forced analogies and metaphors feel natural, not contrived

### ✏️ Punctuation and Structure
- [ ] Simple punctuation used (periods, commas) over complex punctuation (em dashes, semicolons)
- [ ] Sentences are short and clear rather than complex and verbose
- [ ] Parenthetical statements are minimal and don't disrupt reading flow
- [ ] Excessive exclamation points or enthusiastic punctuation avoided

### 👤 Personal Voice Check
- [ ] Content sounds like it came from a real person, not marketing copy
- [ ] Technical explanations are clear and jargon-free when possible
- [ ] Examples and descriptions feel authentic to the person/company
- [ ] Call-to-actions are direct and conversational

### 📋 Content Red Flags
Watch for and flag these patterns:
- [ ] Repetitive "Whether it's..." appearing 2+ times in same section
- [ ] Corporate speak: "synergy", "paradigm shift", "game-changing", "next-generation"
- [ ] AI patterns: "The art of...", "Masters of...", generic superlatives
- [ ] Overly complex sentences that could be simplified
- [ ] Forced enthusiasm that doesn't feel genuine

### ✅ Content Review Process
- [ ] Read content aloud - does it sound like natural speech?
- [ ] Check for repetitive patterns across the entire page/section
- [ ] Ensure technical terms are explained appropriately for the audience
- [ ] Verify that personality comes through without being unprofessional

## Review Process Guidelines
