- [ ] State is kept as local as possible

#### Bundle and Asset Optimization
- [ ] No unnecessary large dependencies added

## Security and Best Practices

### 🔒 Security Considerations

## Code Organization

### 📁 File Structure
- [ ] Files are in appropriate directories
- [ ] New files follow established naming conventions
- [ ] Related files are co-located appropriately
- [ ] Import paths use consistent patterns
- [ ] Index files used appropriately for clean imports

### 🔄 State Management
- [ ] State is managed at appropriate level
- [ ] Global state is justified and necessary
- [ ] State updates are immutable
